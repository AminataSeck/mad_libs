       It’s simple. Turn the {{noun1_key}}. Make him/her want {{adv1_key}} to date you.
       Make sure you’re always dressed to {{verb1_key}}. Each and every day, wear a/an
       {{noun2_key}} that you know shows off your body part to {{adj1_key}} advantage and make your
       {{noun3_key}} look like a million {{noun4_key}}. Even if the two of you make meaningful {{noun5_key}} 
       contact, don’t admit it. No hugs or {{noun6_key}}, just shake his/her {{noun7_key}} firmly.
       And remember, when he/she asks you out, even though a chilly may run down your
       {{noun8_key}}  and you can’t stop your {{noun9_key}} from {{verb2_key}}, just play it {{adj2_key}}. 
       Take a long pause before answering in a very {{adj3_key}} voice. “I’ll have to {{verb3_key}} it over.”

        My {{noun_key}} is wonderful. <br> 
        I like to {{verb_key}} on cold days.

        {{noun_key}} class, our teacher {{noun_key}} takes usto the lab so we can  <br>
        work on cool class projects like finding out who is the oldest {{noun_key}} or what a/an <br>{{noun_key}}eats 
        for breakfast. Last week, Our assignment 
        was to research <br>how many people live in the {{noun_key}}. Since {{noun_key}}<br>
        always lets us pick our {{adj_key}} partners, i chose {{noun_key}} because <br>shes 
        so {{adj_key}}. We had the best time {{verb_key}} on the internet. We found the coolest
        <br>{{noun_key}} that had all information that we needed. We {{verb_key}} awesome facts
        about cities <br> like {{noun_key}} and all the {{noun_key}}  that live in them. Can you
        believe that {{num_key}} people live in {{noun_key}} ? <br>And they love to eat {{noun_key}}
        for breakfast, lunch, {{noun_key}}? Thats a lot of {{noun_key}}!

        Last night at {{noun1_key}} Stadium, {{noun2_key}} played against {{noun3_key}}. It was the {{num1_key}}
        game of the Championship. All the players were {{adj1_key}}. The {{adj2_key}} coach screamed at the
        players that it was do or {{verb1_key}}. If they {{verb2_key}} the game, then their {{noun4_key}} would
        not be in the {{num2_key}} final. The game began {{adv1_key}}. The crowd was shouting : {{noun5_key}}
        so that the team would {{verb3_key}}. At half time the score was {{num3_key}} to {{num4_key}}.
        We went into the {{noun6_key}} and everyone was {{verb4_key}}. We wanted to win the {{noun7_key}}.
        The coach said: Don't be {{adj3_key}}. We will win the {{noun8_key}} if we have to drink {{noun9_key}}
        to do it! At the end we were the {{noun10_key}} and we had a chance to be in the {{noun11_key}} Championship game.

       There has been a silly mix-up at the zoo. The {{noun1_key}} were swimming in the penguin enclosure.
       {{noun2_key}} the polar bear was {{verb1_key}} in the air. When I visited the {{noun3_key}} exhibit,
       they were all {{noun4_key}} and {{verb2_key}}ing. At the petting zoo, {{num1_key}} goats started {{verb3_key}}ing
       at me. We stopped at the concession stand to buy a/an {{noun5_key}} and a/an {{noun6_key}} and a {{noun7_key}} 
       took our order. On our way to the exit, I asked my mom if we could visit my favorite animal. When we got to 
       the {{noun8_key}} house, the sign said they had left to vacation at {{noun9_key}}. I forgot today was
       April Fools Day. I guess the animals really played a trick on me.

        Once upon a time, in a place called {{noun1_key}}, there was a {{adj1_key}} princess named {{noun2_key}}.
        Her kingdom was huge, but her {{noun3_key}} was bigger. She was beautiful from her {{noun4_key}} to her 
        {{noun5_key}}. One day she saw a {{adj2_key}} prince named {{noun6_key}}. He had a {{adj3_key}} face.
        As soon as his {{noun7_key}} touched her {{noun8_key}} they fell in love. They got married at {{noun9_key}}
        the following day. Not long after, they had a baby. They decided to call him {{noun10_key}}. He looked like
        a {{noun11_key}}. He used to {{verb1_key}} {{num1_key}} times a day so that his {{noun12_key}} would be {{adj4_key}}
        and {{adj5_key}}. And they {{verb2_key}} happily ever after! 
        
    {%elif category_key == "best": %}
       Face it, {{noun1_key}}, you are about the greatest thing since  {{noun2_key}}. No one else can {{verb1_key}}
       like you can. Your best friend says you are the {{adj1_key}}. So, today is the day you’re going to stop 
       beating up on yourself for being {{adj2_key}} and start loving yourself for being {{adj3_key}} and {{adj4_key}}.
       And if people give you a {{adj5_key}} time, just tell ‘em they can take their {{noun3_key}} and {{verb2_key}}
       it up their {{noun4_key}}!
